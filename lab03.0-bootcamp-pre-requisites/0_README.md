# Setting up for the bootcamp

The following steps will get us up and running for the bootcamp. These activities take about 2.5 hours in total and should be completed **prior to attending** the bootcamp. Failure to do so will result in falling behind during the workshop and divert time and attention from the material covered throughout the bootcamp. As proof of completion the below steps, bring the "Web Service ID" code (described below) to sign in at the bootcamp.
 
##  What we will need for this workshop: 

 -  A Microsoft Azure account where we can create resources, including Application Insights. This could be an organization account, an MSDN subscription account, a Trial Account, or a work account.
 -  A Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Experimentation and Model Management Account.
 -  A Windows laptop on which we can install software **OR** any machine with **Remote Desktop Connection** so that we can access a remote Windows Data Science Virtual Machine (Note: a **v3** type VM is required to leverage Docker if we chose an Azure DSVM, and this is officially not yet supported).

##  Setting up the environment 

Once we have the above requirements in place, we should be able to execute most of the online Iris tutorial, by performing the below tasks. If we cannot complete all of these pre-requisites, contact the event organizer prior to arrival.

1. Complete all of the steps in the [Iris tutorial part 1][iris-tut-1].
2. Complete all of the steps in the [Iris tutorial part 2][iris-tut-2].
3. Complete most of the steps in the [Iris tutorial part 3][iris-tut-3]. We stop at the section marked **Create a real-time web service in one command**.
4. As a result of running the previous step, we should have a **Web Service ID** which we must bring to the bootcamp in order to sign in.
