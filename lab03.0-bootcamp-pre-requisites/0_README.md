# Setting up for the bootcamp

The following steps will get us up and running for the bootcamp. These activities take about 2.5 hours in total and should be completed **prior to attending** the bootcamp. Failure to do so will put you behind the rest of the class and divert your time and attention from the material covered throughout the bootcamp. As proof that you have completed the below steps, you must bring the "Web Service ID" code (described below) with you to sign in at the bootcamp.
 
##  What you will need for this workshop: 

 -  A Microsoft Azure account where you can create resources, including Application Insights. This could be an organization account, an MSDN subscription account, a Trial Account, or an account provided by your company.
 -  A Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Experimentation and Model Management Account.
 -  A Windows laptop on which you can install software **OR** any machine with **Remote Desktop Connection** so that you can access a remote Windows Data Science Virtual Machine (Note: a **v3** type VM is required to leverage Docker if you chose an Azure DSVM, and this is officially not yet supported).

##  Setting up your environment 

Once you have the above requirements in place, you should be able to execute most of the online Iris tutorial, by performing the below tasks. If you cannot complete all of these pre-requisites, contact the event organizer prior to arrival.

2. Complete all of the steps you find in the [Iris tutorial part 2][iris-tut-2].
3. Complete most of the steps you find in the [Iris tutorial part 3][iris-tut-3]. You may stop after the section marked **Create a real-time web service in one command**.
4. As a result of running the previous step, you should have a **Web Service ID**. Bring that number with you to the bootcamp to sign in.
