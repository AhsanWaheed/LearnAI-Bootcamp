# Collect data from a scoring service

This hands-on lab guides you through collecting Machine Learning scoring  data using [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml) with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. 

In this workshop, you will:
- [ ] Use the Azure Machine Learning Services collection module to view scoring data from API calls
- [ ] Use Azure Storage to view the results

You'll focus on the objectives above, not Data Science, Machine Learning or a difficult scenario.  

***NOTE:*** There are several pre-requisites for this course, including an understanding and implementation of: 
  *  Programming using an Agile methodology
  *  Machine Learning and Data Science
  *  Intermediate to Advancced Python programming
  *  Microsoft Azure Storage concepts
  *  Working with the Azure Portal

There is a comprehensive Learning Path you can use to prepare for this course [located here](https://github.com/Azure/learnAnalytics-CreatingSolutionswiththeTeamDataScienceProcess-/blob/master/Instructions/Learning%20Path%20-%20Creating%20Solutions%20with%20the%20Team%20Data%20Science%20Process.md).

We will review these articles in class: 

  1.  [Model data collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/how-to-use-model-data-collection)
  2.  [Azure Machine Learning Model Data Collection API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-data-collection-api-reference)

The process and flow for using Azure Machine Learning Services has this layout:

### Lab: Collecting Model Data

In this lab you'll use Python to collect scoring data 
- [ ] Open the Azure Machine Learning Services Workbench tool locally or on your Data Science Virtual Machine. 
- [ ] [Navigate to this resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/how-to-use-model-data-collection), and complete all sections there.
- [ ] Run the "az ml service run" section multiple times.
- [ ] Using Power BI, Excel, Spark or HIVE, examine the data from the various runs.

## Workshop Completion

In this workshop you learned how to:
- [ ] Use the Azure Machine Learning Services collection module to view scoring data from API calls
- [ ] Use Azure Storage to view the results

You may now decommission and delete the following resources if you wish:
  * The Azure Machine Learning Services accounts and workspaces
  * Any Data Science Virtual Machines you have created. NOTE: Even if "Shutdown" in the Operating System, unless these Virtual Machines are "Stopped" using the Azure Portal you are incurring run-time charges. If you Stop them in the Azure Portal, you will be charged for the storage the Virtual Machines are consuming.
